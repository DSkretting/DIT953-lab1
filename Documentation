Create abstract supertype Car in its own file.

All attributes Volvo and Saab had in common was declared in Car. Avoids code duplication.

All methods in common were put in Car. They are put to public. If they were abstract, we would need to override them in
each subclass, thus defeating the purpose of inheriting to avoid code duplication.

All attributes that subclasses have in common have been moved to superclass and the different values assigned from
beginning have been set as default
